Each Room should be its own file in the layout folder.
Layout should be:
<Name of the room>
<Short description>
<Long Description>
<direction1,room in that direction1,direction2,room in that direction2,direction3,room in that direction>(this can be repeated as many times as possible)
<Item1>
<Item1 short description>
<Item1 long description>
<Item2>
<Item2 short description>
<Item2 long description>
(You can have as many items in a room as you want)

***IMPORTANT***
Pay attention to case sensitivity.  Rooms will not be connected if the room names differ even slightly.  
Example: if in the living room, you wanted to connect a bathroom to the south, if you name the bathroom <The Bathroom> if the living room file, it must be <The Bathroom> in its own file.

Make sure to leave no new lines anywhere in the .txt files!

Indicate starting room by giving the .txt file a title that will put it at the top of the folder
