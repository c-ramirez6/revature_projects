The Foyer
The main foyer in the house
The foyer is a large room with a hard wood floor.  There is a large chandeller hanging from the high rise celing.  To the north there is a kitchen.  Off to the west there is a dark corridor.  To the south east you see a light coming from what you assume to be a fireplace.

Desk
A large wooden desk.
The large wooden desk seems fairly old.  There are a number of papers scattered across the top of the desk, with what seems to be dripping red ink splattered about.
You search the desk but none of the documents seem very important
Broken Lamp
A broken lamp laying on the floor
The lamp has fallen over at some point causing shards of broken lightbulbs to be scattered across the floor.  There seems to be dried blood on some of the shards.
You go to pickup the broken lamp, but cut yourself on a piece of broken glass
